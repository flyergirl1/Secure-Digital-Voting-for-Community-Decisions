# Digital Community Voting Platform

## Overview

This platform provides a secure, transparent blockchain-based voting system designed for community decision-making. The system is composed of four primary smart contracts that handle different aspects of the voting process:

1. **Voter Verification Contract**: Validates eligibility of community members
2. **Proposal Submission Contract**: Manages issues for consideration
3. **Vote Recording Contract**: Securely stores cast ballots while maintaining privacy
4. **Result Certification Contract**: Tallies votes and confirms outcomes

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Only verified community members can participate
- **Transparent Process**: All proposals and results are publicly visible
- **Privacy Preservation**: Individual votes remain private while ensuring verifiability
- **Tamper-proof Records**: Blockchain technology ensures vote integrity
- **Decentralized Control**: Community governance without central authority

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Small amount of ETH for gas fees
- Community membership credentials

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure your community parameters in `config.js`
4. Deploy contracts: `npm run deploy`

## Usage

### For Voters

1. Connect your wallet
2. Complete verification process
3. View active proposals
4. Cast your vote
5. Verify your vote was recorded
6. View results after voting period ends

### For Administrators

1. Set up community parameters
2. Manage member verification
3. Create and schedule proposals
4. Monitor voting progress
5. Certify results

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature controls for administrative functions
- Zero-knowledge proofs for vote privacy
- Vote encryption until tallying phase
- Independent verification of results
